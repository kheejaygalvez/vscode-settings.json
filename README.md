# VS Code User Settings

Minimal and practical `user.settings.json` for Visual Studio Code.

Focused on a clean UI, readable code, and small quality-of-life improvements.
Used as my personal baseline setup across machines.

## Usage

1. Open VS Code  
2. `Ctrl + Shift + P` → **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**
3. Paste or merge the contents of `user.settings.json`

## Notes

- User-level settings only
- Some settings require extensions
- Adjust freely to fit your workflow
